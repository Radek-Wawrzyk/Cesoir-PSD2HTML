# Cesoir site PSD to HMTL
The main reason why i've created higher mentioned site is that i've wanted to check my present abilities and my Front End level. 
In my opinion comparing this site to my previous work, i can say that there is a huge progress. layout it's not 1:1, cause i've had only graphic from Pinterest (link below), so it hasn't been PSD file. 

Technologies i've used:
- HTML5
- CSS
- SASS (SCSS)
- Javasccript (ES5)
- GULP
